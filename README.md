# Vela Partners Machine Learning Research Micro-Internship - March 2024

Vela Partners is the world's first product-led and AI-powered venture capital firm. 

**Project Brief:** Find and recommend start-ups based on a Venture Capital investment thesis.

**Outcome:** In less than a week, I harnessed Large Language Model (LLM) Agents (openai, langchain), web-scraping (Beautiful Soup and html2text), and API calls (LinkedIn, Crunchbase) to identify relevant startups, scrape information from Y Combinator pages, extract founder data from LinkedIn and Crunchbase to generate a ranking and justification for investment decisions.

This repo contains a summary of the functions I created in a .ipynb file (issues running the code locally) and a requirements.txt file with the relevant packages. 

The main information is under the heading "Final", with the rest of the notebook featuring an experiment to improve ranking algorithms using similarity search (Tfidf vectors) and supervised learning approaches (RankNet algorithm).
